Description: The package is a Monty Hall Problem Simulator.  The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where you choose one of "n" doors, behind the doors are a prize you want, (e.g. a car) and behind the others are prizes you don't want (e.g. goats). After you pick a door, the host, who knows whatâ€™s behind the doors, opens another door and offers you the chance to switch to the another remaining door.
